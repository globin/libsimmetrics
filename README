This is a C port of the Simmetrics project.

SimMetrics is a Similarity Metric Library, e.g. from edit distance's (Levenshtein, Gotoh, Jaro etc) to other metrics, (e.g Soundex, QGrams).

The code was ported from https://github.com/Simmetrics/simmetrics

This project however has advanced beyond the scope of the original Java project and can be considered the better API.

To compile in main directory:
```
cmake .
make
```

Most of the functions return floating points and can be customized.
